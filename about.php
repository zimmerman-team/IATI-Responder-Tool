        IATI responder is developed to inform local comunities about aid development projects.<br>
        In addition the comunity can respond to projects and give feedback, so we can improve the projects.<br>
        The projects map gives a clear view of all the projects near you.<br>
        Furthermore you can select a different location and range with the draggable marker.<br>
        If you hold down for two seconds on the map, the marker will apppear with all the projects near it.
        <br><br> 
        IATI Responder is developed by Mansur Dehpoor an intern at Zimmerman & Zimmerman based in the Netherlands <br>
