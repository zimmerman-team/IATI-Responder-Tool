        IATI responder is developed to inform local comunities about aid development projects.<br>
        In addition the comunity can respond to projects and give feedback, so we can improve these projects.<br>
        <br>
        The projects map gives a clear view of all the projects near you.<br>
        With the draggable marker you can specify a region and search for projects<br>
        If you hold down for two seconds on the map, the marker will apppear with all the projects near it.<br>
        <br> 
        IATI Responder is developed by Mansur Dehpoor an intern at Zimmerman & Zimmerman based in the Netherlands <br>
