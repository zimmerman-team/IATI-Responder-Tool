        IATI Responder gives the possibilty to search worldwide trough thousands of IATI projects.<br>
        The goal of IATI Responder is to provide local communities a better view of aid development projects in their area.<br>
        In addition the community can respond to these projects and give feedback, so we can improve the projects.<br>
        <br>
        The IATI Responder started as an intern project by Mansur Dehpoor at Zimmerman & Zimmerman. <br>
        In cooperation with colleagues the first version of the IATI Responder was set.
